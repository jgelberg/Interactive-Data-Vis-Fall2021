  <div class="intro">
    <p>As New Yorkers we huddle on to subways, buses, and other types of public transportation daily. We rely on its
      safety and (semi) predictable schedule to get us where we need to go.</p>
    <p>However, the most intricate form of transportation, the subway, didn't just appear out of thin air. It took time,
      money, and hard work from three different transportation companies to start what we know today as the MTA or the
      Metropolitan Transit Authority. <a href="https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_First_Subway">At the start of the
        1900s</a>, it grew from just a few stops in downtown Manhattan to over 400 in almost all boroughs of the city
      (Sorry, Staten Island).</p>
    <p>So, yes, the subway is a necessity. But what if you weren't able to take the subway to work or school? You may
      think, "How could this be possible?". Well, there are barriers to entry, literally and figurately for many
      citizens. The biggest barrier, in my opinion, is physical accessibility. By this I mean two things: physical entry
      and spatial density. First, let's break down physical entry. </p>
    <p>Say, you broke your leg. Whoops. Now you are in crutches and a cast or maybe even use one of those scooters to
      get around. You've already taken all of your vacation days and need to go back to work (in a world without a
      deadly pandemic). You start heading towards your preferred subway stop. You arrive and you realize your platform
      is elevated. You begin to look for an elevator. Guess what? There aren't any to be found. You think to yourself,
      "How the heck is this even possible? There is the <a href="https://beta.ada.gov/">ADA Act (1990)</a> here in the
      good ol' United States.". In a turn of events, NYC has evaded the law for some time since the subways are so old
      and it would cost a tremendous amount to make amends and accessible buses exist, etc.
      <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html">According to the
        CDC</a>, 1 in 4 Americans is disabled. Additionally, NYC has disclosed that about <a
        href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/mopd/downloads/pdf/accessiblenyc-2018.pdf">11% of its citizens are disabled as
        well.</a> Now, think about if you constantly relied on a wheelchair to get around. Figuring out which stops are
      accessible and planning your route would simply be unbearable. "Which lines can I take?" "Will the elevator even
      work today?" Subway systems are supposed to be designed in order to make lives easier, not harder. Governments
      need to assist all citizens. If this mode of transportation is helping most but not all, are they even doing their
      job?
    </p>
    <p>The graph below represents the count of stops per colored line that are accessible, not acessible and somehwat
      accessible. Here, "somewhat accessible" indicates that the station may have an elevator for uptown trains only or
      certain lines within a larger station complex. Hover over the map of the five boroughs to see more information.

      <p> We know that there is a literal barrier to enter subways for some of our city's citizens but there is a
        figurative one as well.
        Look at the density of the stops compared to the area of the borough. How come the farther away you are from the
        center of Manhattan, a decreasing number of subway stops are available?
        About a third of Queens is a subway desert. You can see similar examples in Brooklyn and the Bronx the further
        you move away from Manhattan. While Manhattan is the heart of the city, it is simply 1 of 5 boroughs that
        comprise New York City. Why has it received the most attention? Is it because its residents are on average the
        richest based on the median household average income per borough?
        In the US, there is also income inequality dependant on race. Black, Latinx, and other minority households <a
          href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm">make
          considerably less than white families.</a>
        The outer boroughs (Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn), maybe you've guessed, have a higher "minority" population than
        Manhattan. Simply to highlight, 33% of Bronx residents identify as Black, 25% of Queens residents identify as
        Asian, and 20% of Brooklyn's population identify as Hispanic. The full breakdown by the NYC Department of
        Planning can be viewed <a
          href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-and-Housing-Profiles-by-Borough/cu9u-3r5e">
          here</a>.
        As the outer boroughs decrease in the average living wage and increase in people of color, we can infer that the
        subway was intended for the white and wealthy.
      </p>
      <p>While this situation is hopefully not on purpose, the data is clear. The New York City subway system has
        alienated 30-40% of its population based on race and disability status. While I'm not a city planner nor a
        politician, I hope someone who is can understand this viewpoint and bring awareness and action to this issue.
